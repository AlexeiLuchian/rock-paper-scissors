This is the "Rock Paper Scissors" project from TOP, where after learning the JavaScript basics, I was supposed to code this mini-game where a player can play against a bot, that way demonstrating my unserstanding of variables and operators, data types and conditionals, function basics and understanding errors, all that while developing other important skills like problem solving and working with JavaScript Developer Tools.  
You can check and play the game on the following link: https://alexeiluchian.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/  
Bare in mind that the page will be fully empty and only a prompt will appear after loading the page. In order to see the results you should open the console. (If you're using Chrome you can do that by pressing F12 and selecting the 'Console' tab)
